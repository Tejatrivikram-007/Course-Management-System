# Course Management System Web Application

This repository contains the source code for a **Course Management System Web Application** developed using **React.js**, **HTML**, and **CSS**. The web application is designed to help educators and students manage their courses, track assignments, and provide an interactive experience for users to view and manage course-related data.

## Features

- **Course Dashboard**: Displays a list of courses the user is enrolled in or teaching.
- **Add/Edit/Delete Courses**: Teachers can add, edit, or delete courses easily.
- **Assignment Tracking**: Students can view their assignments and submission statuses.
- **Student/Teacher Roles**: Two user roles (Student & Teacher) with different permissions.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is designed to be responsive and works on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Course Search**: Allows searching and filtering of courses by name or category.
- **Modern UI/UX Design**: Built with a clean and intuitive design using CSS and React components.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building the user interface.
- **HTML5**: For structuring the webpage and content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the page and ensuring responsiveness.
- **React Router**: For navigation between pages within the application.
- **Axios**: For handling HTTP requests to fetch course data (optional for integration with back-end APIs).

## Demo

### Example Code for the Course Management System (React.js)

Here’s an example of the basic structure of the **React.js components** for the application.

#### `App.js`:

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import CourseList from './components/CourseList';
import AddCourse from './components/AddCourse';

function App() {
  const [courses, setCourses] = useState([
    { id: 1, name: 'React Basics', description: 'Introduction to React.' },
    { id: 2, name: 'JavaScript Essentials', description: 'Learn JavaScript fundamentals.' },
  ]);

  const addCourse = (course) => {
    setCourses([...courses, course]);
  };

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>Course Management System</h1>
      <AddCourse addCourse={addCourse} />
      <CourseList courses={courses} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

#### `CourseList.js` (Component to list courses):

```js
import React from 'react';

const CourseList = ({ courses }) => {
  return (
    <div className="course-list">
      <h2>Course List</h2>
      <ul>
        {courses.map((course) => (
          <li key={course.id}>
            <h3>{course.name}</h3>
            <p>{course.description}</p>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CourseList;
```

#### `AddCourse.js` (Component to add new courses):

```js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const AddCourse = ({ addCourse }) => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [description, setDescription] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const newCourse = { id: Date.now(), name, description };
    addCourse(newCourse);
    setName('');
    setDescription('');
  };

  return (
    <div className="add-course">
      <h2>Add New Course</h2>
      <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
        <input
          type="text"
          placeholder="Course Name"
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
        <textarea
          placeholder="Course Description"
          value={description}
          onChange={(e) => setDescription(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button type="submit">Add Course</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AddCourse;
```

### Final Steps:
Once your app is built, simply push it to your GitHub repository. You can then share the repository with others or deploy it using **Netlify** or **Vercel** for the front-end, and use services like **Heroku** for a back-end if needed.

Hope this helps you get started with your **Course Management System** repository!
